#above we import json module to use it in the code below.JSON  (JavaScript Object Notation) is a file that is mainly used to store and transfer data mostly between a server and a web application. It is popularly used for representing structured data.Python provides a module called json which comes with Pythonâ€™s standard built-in utility.Note: In Python, JSON data is usually represented as a string.

#the (decorators)are which changes the functionality of a function.as we know the (crsf) token prevents any cross (post request) from any other source,like when you give details to paytm [to take money from this user and send it to my merchant id.then paytm will get all details and will take money from user after verifying everything but it won't be able TO SEND OUR WEBSITE ANY "POST"  REQUEST THAT THE THE PAYMENT HAS BEEN MADE. THIS IS BECAUSE OF (CRSF) TOKEN.SO TO RESTRICT IT FUNCTIONALITY ONLY IN SOME PARTICULAR PART WE IMPORT THE BELOW MWTHOD.

def index(request):
    products = Product.objects.all()
    # above we store the list of all the products stored in table or model (Product) in a variable called "products".this we do with the help of statement (Product.objects.all()) which we have already seen in (shell) of (terminal).
    #print(products)
    # the above prints all the products.(which we can only see in the terminal.)
    #n= len(products)
    # (n) is the length of [list] called "products"(products list stores a list of products which is 7 in this case as we have stored 7 products. )

    # BELOW FORMULA IS JUST SIMPLE DIVISION PROBLEM THAT YOU TEACH TO STD 3RD KIDS. MEANS IF YOU HAVE 100 PRODUCTS(i.e, n=100) THEN HOW MANY [GROUPS OF 4 CARDS(AS there has to be 4 cards in a single slide)] YOU CAN MAKE.SO WE SIMPLY [DIVIDE 100 BY 4]AND GET (25) AS THE ANSWER,SO THERE WILL BE 25 SLIDES HAVING 4 CARDS EACH INSIDE THEM.
    #nSlides= n//4 + ceil((n/4) - (n//4))
    # SEE THE ABOVE FORMULA WILL GIVE THE (NUMBER OF SLIDES(or GROUP of 4 cards) THAT WE NEED TO SHOW).that is if we have 100 products then what no. of slides will be there? and if there are only 10 products then how many slides we need? . MEANING : see like we have entered 7 products in the database table so the value of n=7. and the FORMULA ABOVE WILL  RETURN THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF SLIDES HAVING 4 CARDS OR PRODUCTS EACH.AS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT NUMBER OF PRODUCTS WILL BE ADDED TO THE DATABASE IN FUTURE SO WE CANNOT DECIDE THE TOTAL NO. OF SLIDES TO SHOW IN THE WEBSITE.so this method helps us in this way.[EX: for n=7 ,nSlides = 7//4 + ceil((7/4) - (7//4)) = 1 + ceil(1.75 - 1) = 1 + ceil(0.75 = 1+1 =2)]{calculated all these calues from python console in pycharm}.SO IN CASE OF 7 PRODUCTS WE'LL NEED 2 SLIDES. [SEE HARRY'S VIDEO ON THIS LOGIC,HE HAS WELL EXPLAINED THIS THING.]
